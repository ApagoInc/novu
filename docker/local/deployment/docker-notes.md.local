Currently, the novu containers must each be built before ever running docker-compose.

Except for our custom "proxy" container, the others must pull from a pre-built image.

Also, the main "web" build is broken, due to  existing bugs in the Novu build for a self-hosted docker environment.
As a result, we will use the default React server to host the files until a fix can be made for the static build.
